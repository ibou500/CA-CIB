Done:
1. We have respected the specifications of the application. 
2. The user can see in real time the FX rate. We added the date in the table.
3. N/A is used if no override.
TO do:
1. We can add flags to represent USD and EUR
2. We can add a chart to see the evolution of the FX rate over time
3. We can improve the application by making objects like oop. These objects would add other currencies.
4. Use database to store the evolution of different currency
5. We can add a table summarizing the exchange rate of each currency with the charts.
6. I guess we can fetch the exchange rates by a dedicated api instead of using a random one.
7. We can improve the front-end especially in terms of responsive design
8. Use components
